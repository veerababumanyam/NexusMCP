# Integration Hub : Enterprise Integration Capabilities

## 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Ensuring secure and centralized user authentication and authorization.
*   **Directory Services Integration:**
    *   **Protocol:** LDAP v3 (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
    *   **Supported Directories (Examples):** Microsoft Active Directory (Primary), other standard LDAP v3 compliant directories (e.g., OpenLDAP).
    *   **Purpose:** Provides connectivity for direct authentication or group synchronization with traditional directory services
*   **Standardized Single Sign-On (SSO):**
    *   **Protocols:** SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC) / OAuth 2.0
    *   **Supported Providers (Examples):** Compatibility with any standard-compliant Identity Provider (IdP), including major platforms like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Okta, Ping Identity, Google Workspace, OneLogin, Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Shibboleth, and others.
    *   **Purpose:** Enables users to authenticate using their existing corporate credentials via their organization's chosen IdP, enhancing security and user experience.
*   **Automated User Provisioning:**
    *   **Protocol:** SCIM 2.0 (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
    *   **Purpose:** Automates the lifecycle management (creation, updates, deactivation) of user accounts and group memberships within our application, synchronized with the central enterprise IdP. This reduces administrative burden and improves security posture.

## 2. Support & IT Service Management (ITSM)

Streamlining support workflows by connecting with enterprise ticketing systems.

## 3. Communication & Notification

Integrating with enterprise communication channels for system alerts and user notifications.

*   **Email Delivery:**
    *   **Integration:** Ability to configure and use enterprise SMTP relays.
    *   **Providers (Examples):** SendGrid, Postfix, Microsoft 365/Exchange Online SMTP relay services.

*   **SMS Notifications:**
    *   **Integration:** Ability to connect with SMS Gateway providers.
    *   **Providers (Examples):** Twilio, Vonage, Plivo.

## 4. API, WAF 
*   **AR-1: API Gateway Integration:** The system MUST leverage an enterprise-grade API Gateway as the primary ingress point. The API Gateway is responsible for initial request reception, TLS termination (or passthrough for mTLS), basic validation, rate limiting, potential initial authentication/authorization offloading, and routing to appropriate backend gateway processing units or services.
*   **AR-2: Web Application Firewall (WAF):** All ingress traffic MUST pass through a WAF before reaching the API Gateway or any gateway components. The WAF must be configured with rulesets to protect against 

## 5. Monitoring, Logging & Observability

Providing visibility into application health, performance, and usage within the enterprise monitoring ecosystem.

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) & Infrastructure Monitoring:**
    *   **Supported Tools (Examples):** Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Grafana, Prometheus
    *   **Methods:** Exporting key performance indicators (KPIs) and health metrics via standardized endpoints (e.g., Prometheus exposition format), Health check APIs (e.g., `/health` endpoints compatible with standard monitoring probes).
*   **Log Aggregation:**
    *   **Supported Systems (Examples):** Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Graylog, Datadog Logs, Azure Monitor Log Analytics, Google Cloud Logging
    *   **Methods:** Forwarding application logs in standardized formats (e.g., JSON, Syslog, CEF, LEEF) to centralized logging platforms.


## 6. Data Storage, Analytics & Business Intelligence (BI)

Facilitating data exchange for reporting, analytics, and centralized data warehousing.

*   **Data Lake / Warehouse Integration:**
    *   **Supported Platforms (Examples):** AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift
    *   **Methods:** Secure API endpoints for data push/pull, Scheduled data exports (configurable formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet), Dedicated connectors where available.
*   **Business Intelligence (BI) Tool Connectivity:**
    *   **Supported Tools (Examples):** Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Qlik
    *   **Methods:** Direct platform connectors (if available), Standardized API endpoints (REST/GraphQL) for data querying, Compatibility via data export to warehouses/lakes.
*   **ETL/ELT Tool Compatibility:**
    *   **Supported Tools (Examples):** Fivetran, Informatica, Talend, Stitch, MuleSoft, Dell Boomi
    *   **Methods:** Webhook notifications for data events, API compatibility, Standardized data export formats.
	
## 7. Workflow Automation & Integration Platforms (iPaaS)

Enabling custom workflows and connecting with broader enterprise automation strategies.

*   **APIs:**
    *   **Type:** Comprehensive RESTful and/or GraphQL APIs covering application functionality.

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   **Supported Systems (Examples):** Splunk Enterprise Security, IBM QRadar, Azure Sentinel, ArcSight
    *   **Methods:** Forwarding security-relevant logs (e.g., authentication events, permission changes, critical actions) in standard formats (CEF, LEEF).
