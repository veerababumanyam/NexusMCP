**Objective:** Enahnce, Design, develop, and integrate an enterprise-grade **Policy Management System** with full policy lifecycle support, integrated RBAC enforcement, and Open Policy Agent (OPA)-based evaluation ‚Äî fully compatible with SaaS architecture and enterprise compliance needs.

### üß© **Policy Administration Features (Frontend + Backend)**
Implement a full-featured **Policy Admin Console** supporting:

* **Policy CRUD Operations**: Create, update, delete, archive, and clone policies
* **Bulk Actions**: Batch delete, import/export, enable/disable
* **Approval Workflow**: Multi-level, role-based policy change approval system with email/WebSocket-based real-time status updates
* **Audit Logging**: Every change and request evaluation must be logged with user, timestamp, action, and context
* **Policy Templates**: Provide a library of pre-built templates (e.g., read-only access, elevated privileges, workspace-based limits)
* **Policy Versioning**: Auto-version policies on every change with diff view and rollback
* **Policy Testing**: In-console simulation of policy against mock user or request payloads
* **Policy Visualization**: UI to display policy graph/structure, decision trees, and dependency chains
* **Policy Impact Analysis**: Identify downstream services and users affected by policy changes

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Policy Engine and Enforcement**
**Backend Modules** to integrate with Open Policy Agent (OPA) and provide robust enforcement:

* **OPA Integration**:
  * Embed OPA as a sidecar or server mode
  * Use **Rego policies** stored in DB or GitOps
  * Support dynamic policy reloading on update

* **Policy Evaluation Flow**:
  ```
  Request ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Policy Engine (OPAClient) ‚Üí Decision (Allow/Deny) ‚Üí Audit Log ‚Üí Proceed/Abort
  ```

* **Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs)**:
  * API Gateway
  * Workspace-specific dashboards
  * Server access and tool configuration layers
  * CLI and plugin endpoints

* **RBAC + Policy Checks**:
  * Enforce workspace/server/tool/user-level permissions
  * Combine static roles with dynamic policies (hybrid enforcement)

* **Context-Aware Evaluation**:
  * Use `WorkspaceContext`, `UserContext`, and `RequestContext`
  * Support dynamic attributes (e.g., time-based, geolocation, user department)

### üìä **Dashboards & Interfaces**
Build modern, accessible interfaces:

* **React-based Admin Dashboard**:
  * Create/assign/test policies visually
  * Real-time status for approvals and rejections
  * Charts for policy usage, denials, violations

* **CLI & REST APIs**:
  * Full policy lifecycle actions
  * Role-based API key support
  * GitOps-compatible endpoints for CI/CD policies

### üõ° **Enterprise-Grade Requirements**

Ensure the implementation meets compliance and scalability needs:

* **Compliance**:
  * WCAG 2.1 AA+, ARIA, ISO27001-ready
  * Internationalization support (30+ languages)

* **Testing & Automation**:
  * End-to-end testing using Cypress/Playwright
  * Unit tests for PolicyEngine and API layers
  * CI integration with GitHub Actions or GitLab

* **Security**:
  * Zero-trust by default
  * Optional encryption of policy definitions
  * MFA support for admin actions

#### ‚úÖ **Policy-as-Code & GitOps Integration**
* Support Git-based policy sync (pull/push)
* Enable CI/CD hooks for policy deployment with approval
* Dry-run execution to preview impact of policy changes

#### üîê **Enhanced Access Control with ABAC**
* Extend RBAC with attribute-based access control (ABAC)
* Evaluate policies based on dynamic factors (time, IP, request size, etc.)
* Integrate with OPA (Rego) for ABAC rule definitions

#### üß± **Tenant & Workspace Isolation**
* Namespace policies per workspace/tenant
* Prevent cross-tenant conflicts with isolated policy registries

#### üß™ **Policy Simulation Sandbox**
* Build a test environment for:

  * Simulating policy evaluations
  * Debugging policy failures
  * Previewing workflow impacts without affecting live users

#### üö® **Policy Usage Anomaly Detection**
* Real-time monitoring of policy usage
* Alerting system for:
  * Unusual access patterns
  * High denial rates
  * Frequent rule modifications

#### ‚è≥ **Time-Bound Access Policies**
* Temporary roles/privileges with:
  * Expiry time
  * Auto-revert
  * Approval-based escalation

#### üè∑Ô∏è **Policy Tagging & Categorization**
* Allow policy tagging for:
  * Security, Workflow, Billing, etc.
  * Filtering and impact analysis by tag

#### üåê **Live Policy Heatmap Dashboard**
* Visual representation of:
  * Frequently used policies
  * Dormant/unused rules
  * Critical failure points

#### üåç **Multi-Region Policy Replication**
* Replicate policy definitions across multiple regions
* Ensure low-latency, fault-tolerant policy access

#### üí¨ **ChatOps for Policy Approval**
* Integrate policy approval workflows into:
  * Slack
  * Microsoft Teams
  * Discord
* Notify and approve directly from chat

Ensure full support for REST APIs, unit testing, audit logging, and workspace-based access controls across all new components. Maintain compatibility with OPA and existing RBAC models.
