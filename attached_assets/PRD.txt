## Infrastructure & Runtime Configuration

- **Runtime Configurability:** The platform must allow secure, auditable, and UI/API-accessible configuration of:
  - Hostnames and network interfaces (for multi-tenant, hybrid, or air-gapped deployments)
  - IP addresses and DNS settings
  - LDAP/Active Directory integration for user/group sync and authentication
  - SMTP settings for notifications, alerts, and password resets
- **Auditability:** All changes to infrastructure/network settings must be logged and reviewable.
- **Documentation:** All environment/network parameters must be clearly documented for deployment and runtime management.

## Security & Policy Engine Implementation

**Approach:** NexusMCP implements security policies at multiple layers, following zero-trust and enterprise cyber security best practices.

### a) Policy Enforcement Points
- **RBAC:** User/role/workspace/server/tool-level access control for all actions (API, UI, workflows).
- **Policy Engine:** Centralized engine (e.g., Open Policy Agent/OPA) to evaluate access, data, and workflow policies before execution.
- **Audit Logging:** Every access, change, and sensitive action is logged with user, time, context, and outcome.

### b) Cyber Security Controls
- **Identity & Access Management:** SSO (OIDC/SAML), MFA, just-in-time access, privileged access management.
- **Network Security:** TLS 1.3, API gateway, WAF, DDoS protection, micro-segmentation.
- **Data Security:** Encryption at rest/in transit, tokenization, masking, data classification, secure key management.
- **Application Security:** Secure SDLC, dependency scanning, container security, runtime protection.
- **Threat Detection:** SIEM integration, anomaly detection, alerting, automated response playbooks.
- **Pen-Testing & Audits:** Regular 3rd-party/internal security assessments, continuous compliance monitoring.
- **Secrets Management:** Vault integration, automated secrets rotation, no secrets in code/config.

### c) Implementation in Code/Platform
- Use open-source policy engines (e.g., OPA) for runtime policy evaluation.
- Integrate with IAM solutions (e.g., Keycloak) for authentication/authorization.
- Build policy configuration and enforcement into the admin UI and workflow engine.
- Provide APIs for policy definition, testing, and audit review.
- Document all active policies and provide audit trails for compliance.
