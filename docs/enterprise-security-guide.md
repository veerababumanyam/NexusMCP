# Enterprise Security Guide for NexusMCP

## Overview

NexusMCP is built with enterprise-grade security at its core. This guide provides detailed information about the security features implemented in NexusMCP, with a focus on:

1. OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow
2. IP-based Access Control
3. Token Rotation and Monitoring
4. Enhanced Security Monitoring
5. Compliance Reporting
6. SSO Integration

## 1. OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow

NexusMCP implements the OAuth2 Client Credentials flow, a secure authentication method designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. This flow is ideal for server-to-server API interactions where a traditional login isn't possible.

### Features

- **Secure Client Registration**: Register API clients with strong, automatically generated credentials
- **Scope-based Access Control**: Limit client access to specific API resources
- **Token Issuance and Validation**: Generate and validate JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Track all authentication and authorization events

### Implementation Details

The OAuth2 Client Credentials flow is implemented in the following components:

- `OAuth2ClientCredentialsService`: Core service that handles client registration, token issuance, and validation
- `oauth2-middleware`: Express middleware for protecting API routes with token validation
- Database tables for storing clients, tokens, and audit logs

## 2. IP-based Access Control

IP-based Access Control adds an additional security layer to the OAuth2 flow by restricting client access based on IP addresses and time windows.

### Features

- **IP Allowlist**: Restrict client access to specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Limit access to specific days and time windows
- **Automatic Violation Detection**: Track and respond to access attempts from unauthorized IPs
- **Auto-revocation**: Automatically disable clients after suspicious activities

### Implementation Details

IP-based Access Control is implemented in the following components:

- `OAuthIpAccessControlService`: Service that manages IP allowlists and time windows
- Database tables for storing IP allowlists, time windows, and access logs
- Integration with the OAuth2 middleware to reject requests from unauthorized IPs

## 3. Token Rotation and Monitoring

The Token Rotation and Monitoring system enforces security best practices for credential lifecycle management and provides visibility into token usage patterns.

### Features

- **Credential Expiration**: Enforce periodic rotation of client secrets
- **Secret Rotation Policies**: Configure custom rotation periods for different clients
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track token requests, denials, and API usage
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual usage patterns that may indicate security issues
- **Proactive Notifications**: Receive alerts for expiring credentials and suspicious activities

### Implementation Details

Token Rotation and Monitoring is implemented in the following components:

- `OAuthTokenRotationService`: Service that manages credential rotation and usage monitoring
- Database tables for tracking secret history, token usage statistics, and security events
- Event-driven architecture for real-time monitoring and alerting

## 4. Enhanced Security Monitoring

The Enhanced Security Monitoring system provides real-time visibility into the security posture of your OAuth2 services.

### Features

- **Real-time Metrics**: Collect and visualize security metrics in customizable dashboards
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically identify unusual patterns using statistical models
- **Proactive Alerting**: Receive notifications about security events via email or webhooks
- **Health Monitoring**: Track the health of authentication components
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize security metrics and trends

### Implementation Details

Enhanced Security Monitoring is implemented in the following components:

- `OAuthMonitoringService`: Service that collects metrics, detects anomalies, and manages alerts
- Database tables for storing metrics, alerts, and dashboard configurations
- Statistical models for detecting anomalies in authentication patterns

## 5. Compliance Reporting

The Compliance Reporting system helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by providing comprehensive evidence of security controls.

### Features

- **Compliance Frameworks**: Support for multiple compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- **Evidence Collection**: Automatically collect and organize evidence of compliance
- **Scheduled Reports**: Generate compliance reports on a regular schedule
- **Remediation Tracking**: Track and manage compliance issues
- **Exportable Reports**: Generate reports in multiple formats (JSON, PDF, CSV)

### Implementation Details

Compliance Reporting is implemented in the following components:

- `OAuthComplianceService`: Service that manages compliance frameworks and generates reports
- Database tables for storing compliance frameworks, evidence, and reports
- Integration with security event tracking for comprehensive evidence collection

## 6. SSO Integration

The SSO Integration system allows NexusMCP to integrate with enterprise identity providers for seamless authentication.

### Features

- **Multiple Protocol Support**: Integration with SAML 2.0, OIDC, and OAuth2 identity providers
- **Federation**: Support for multiple identity providers
- **JWT Token Management**: Issue and validate JWT tokens for secure communication
- **Session Management**: Track and manage SSO sessions
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Record all authentication events

### Implementation Details

SSO Integration is implemented in the following components:

- `OAuthSsoService`: Service that manages identity providers, service providers, and authentication flows
- Database tables for storing identity provider configurations, service provider configurations, and sessions
- Support for standard SSO protocols (SAML 2.0, OIDC)

## Best Practices

### Security Configuration

1. **Client Credential Rotation**: Rotate client credentials every 90 days
2. **IP Restrictions**: Limit client access to known IP addresses
3. **Time Restrictions**: Restrict access to business hours when possible
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities
5. **Logging**: Retain authentication logs for at least 90 days

### Operational Security

1. **Regular Audits**: Review access logs and security events weekly
2. **Incident Response**: Establish procedures for responding to security alerts
3. **Training**: Train administrators on security features and best practices
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of security configurations
5. **Testing**: Regularly test security controls through penetration testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Token Validation Failures**:
   - Check that the client has the required scopes
   - Verify that the client's IP is in the allowlist
   - Check if the token has expired

2. **IP Access Violations**:
   - Verify the client's IP address
   - Check the IP allowlist configuration
   - Review time window restrictions

3. **Secret Rotation Issues**:
   - Ensure the client is using the current secret
   - Check for rotation notification emails
   - Verify the rotation policy configuration
