fix all Misalignments Identified to match the above flow:
Resource Concept Mismatch: The workspace resources implementation appears to focus on general "resources" rather than specifically integration configurations with external services
Gateway Flow: Some components may be treating NexusMCP as a management platform rather than primarily a gateway/proxy
Integration Configuration: While integration configuration exists, the connection between workspaces and available integrations needs strengthening

Recommended Actions
Enhance the proxy flow to better match the sequence diagram
Ensure policy enforcement specifically evaluates access to integration configurations
Refocus workspace resources to clearly represent available integrations/connections
