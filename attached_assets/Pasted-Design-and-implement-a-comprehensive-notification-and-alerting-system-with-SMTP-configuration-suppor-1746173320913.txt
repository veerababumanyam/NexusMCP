Design and implement a comprehensive notification and alerting system with SMTP configuration support for an enterprise-grade SaaS application.

### ✅ Enhanced Requirements: SMTP & Notification System

**1. SMTP Configuration Module**
* UI/CLI for configuring SMTP (host, port, credentials, TLS/SSL)
* Support for popular email services (Gmail, Outlook, custom SMTP)
* Environment-specific SMTP configs (Dev, Staging, Prod)
* Connection test & verification feature
* Secrets encryption for SMTP credentials (e.g., Vault, KMS)

**2. Notification Management**
* Channels: Email, Webhooks, Slack/MS Teams, In-app, SMS (optional via plugin)
* Templates: Customizable HTML/email templates with variables and branding
* Notification Throttling: Limit alert frequency per user/group
* Prioritization: Critical, Warning, Info classification
* Retry Mechanism: Configurable retries for failed sends with exponential backoff
* Audit Logging: Log every notification sent with delivery status

**3. Alerts & Trigger Configuration**
* Event-based alerts (e.g., user login failure, policy violation, system crash)
* Threshold-based triggers (e.g., CPU > 90% for 5 minutes)
* Support for custom rule definitions (e.g., JSON logic or expressions)
* Workspace-scoped alert configs with RBAC
* Quiet hours / Do Not Disturb configuration

**4. Notification Delivery & UI**
* In-app notification center with real-time updates (WebSockets)
* Read/unread tracking, filters, and mark-all-as-read
* Email digests and summaries (daily/weekly)
* Alert history view with severity filtering

**5. Extensibility**
* Plugin-based architecture for adding new notification channels
* REST and WebSocket APIs for pushing external alerts
* Multi-language support and i18n for templates

> Core Requirements:
> * **SMTP Integration:** Provide UI, API, and CLI support for setting up, testing, and securely storing SMTP configurations per environment.
> * **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Implement email, Slack, webhook, and in-app channels using a plugin-friendly architecture.
> * **Alerting Framework:** Create an event and threshold-based alert trigger system with customizable rules and templates.
> * **Notification Center UI:** Build a real-time in-app notification center with filters, priority sorting, and read status.
> * **Template Engine:** Develop a templating system for emails and messages with branding and i18n support.
> * **Resilience:** Include retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, logging, and monitoring for failures.
> * **RBAC & Workspace Isolation:** Ensure all alerts are scoped to the user’s permissions and workspace.
> * **Compliance & Security:** Encrypt SMTP secrets, log all alerts, and provide auditability for all sends and events.
