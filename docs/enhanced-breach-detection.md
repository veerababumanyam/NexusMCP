# Enhanced Breach Detection System

## Overview

The Enhanced Breach Detection System is an enterprise-grade security feature designed to detect, respond to, and manage security breaches across your NexusMCP environment. It integrates with multiple security components including IP Access Control, Token Monitoring, and OAuth events to provide comprehensive security monitoring and alerting.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Breach Detection**: Continuously monitors security events across the platform and identifies potential breaches based on predefined rules.
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Collects and analyzes data from IP access controls, token usage patterns, OAuth events, and monitoring anomalies.
- **Rule-Based Detection**: Configure detection rules based on behavior patterns, specific signatures, anomalies, or correlation of events.
- **Customizable Severity Levels**: Classify breaches by severity (critical, high, medium, low) for appropriate response prioritization.
- **Comprehensive Event Tracking**: Records all events related to each breach for detailed forensic analysis.
- **False Positive Management**: Built-in workflow for handling and learning from false positive detections.
- **Security Scoring**: Calculates an overall security score based on active breaches and other security metrics.
- **Recommended Actions**: Generates prioritized remediation recommendations based on detected security issues.

## Getting Started

### Understanding Breach Types

The system supports several types of breach detection:

1. **Behavior-based**: Detects anomalies in user or system behavior patterns
2. **Signature-based**: Identifies known attack patterns and security threats
3. **Anomaly-based**: Detects statistical deviations from normal operations
4. **Correlation-based**: Identifies relationships between multiple security events
5. **Manual**: Allows security administrators to manually record and track breaches

### Working with Breach Detections

1. **View Active Breaches**: Navigate to `/api/breach-detection/breaches` to see all active breach detections
2. **Filter Breaches**: Filter by status, severity, type, source, or date range
3. **View Breach Details**: Examine specific breach details including affected resources, evidence, and related events
4. **Resolve Breaches**: Mark breaches as resolved after addressing the security issue
5. **Flag False Positives**: Identify false positive detections to improve detection accuracy

### Managing Detection Rules

1. **View Rules**: Access `/api/breach-detection/breach-rules` to view existing detection rules
2. **Create Rules**: Define new detection rules based on your security requirements
3. **Test Rules**: Test rules against historical data before enabling them
4. **Configure Thresholds**: Set appropriate thresholds to balance detection sensitivity and false positives

## Integration with Other Security Features

The Enhanced Breach Detection System is designed to work closely with other security components in the NexusMCP platform:

### OAuth IP Access Control Integration

- Monitors IP access violations and suspicious patterns
- Tracks allowlist violations and time-based access restrictions
- Provides input for breach detection rules focused on access control

### OAuth Token Rotation Integration

- Monitors token usage patterns and identifies suspicious activities
- Detects token reuse, abuse, or unauthorized access attempts
- Provides input for breach detection rules focused on credential security

### OAuth Monitoring Integration

- Tracks overall system health and security events
- Identifies anomalies in service behavior and performance
- Provides input for breach detection rules focused on system integrity

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Conservative Rules**: Begin with less sensitive detection rules and adjust as you learn your environment's normal behavior.
2. **Regular Review**: Schedule regular review of breach detections to identify patterns and improve rule accuracy.
3. **Prioritize by Severity**: Always address critical and high severity breaches first.
4. **Document Response Procedures**: Create standardized response procedures for different types of breaches.
5. **Regular Testing**: Periodically test your detection rules to ensure they remain effective.
6. **Workspace Scoping**: Use workspace-specific rules for environments with different security requirements.
7. **Use the Security Score**: Monitor your security score over time as a high-level metric of your security posture.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Too Many False Positives**: Adjust rule thresholds or add more specific conditions to reduce false positives.
2. **Missing Breaches**: Check if appropriate rules are enabled and properly configured.
3. **Delayed Detection**: Review rule evaluation intervals and consider increasing frequency for critical rules.
4. **Performance Impact**: For large environments, consider adjusting rule evaluation schedules to balance security and performance.
