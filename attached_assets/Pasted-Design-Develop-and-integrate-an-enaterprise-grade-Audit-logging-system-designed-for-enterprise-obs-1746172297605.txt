Design, Develop, and integrate an enaterprise grade Audit logging system designed for enterprise observability, compliance, and security.

Here is a breakdown of the logs and the standards/features related to their capture and sharing:

**What is Logged (Complete List):**
The platform provides **comprehensive audit logging** for a wide range of events and actions. This includes:
*   **All security-relevant events**.
*   **All system events** with detailed context.
*   **All operations** including MCP requests, connections, authentication, and administrative actions.
*   **All sensitive/admin actions**.
*   **All admin actions and policy changes**.
*   Every **access, change, and sensitive action**, tracking the user, time, context, and outcome.
*   Specific sensitive actions such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and test operations within the MCP Server Management Dashboard.
*   Audit log entries include the action, user, timestamp, and result or error for traceability.
*   All policy changes.
*   Notification-related actions are logged.
*   All changes to infrastructure or network settings must be logged and reviewable.
*   Audit logging is implemented for **all API endpoints** and **workflows**.
*   Tool usage and performance metrics are tracked.
*   Authentication-related metrics are tracked.
*   Usage and behavioral analytics are supported.
*   Plugin metrics and status are available.
*   Audit trails are available for policy definition, testing, and review.

**How Logs are Captured and Managed (Standards & Features):**
NexusMCP follows enterprise security and compliance best practices for handling audit logs:
*   Uses a **structured log format** with user, action, resource, and outcome tracking.
*   Implements **PII masking** (Personally Identifiable Information) in logs with configurable data masking rules. Sensitive data is securely managed and encrypted, and not exposed in error messages or health/alert events. Credentials and secrets are stored securely.
*   Employs an **AES-256-CBC encrypted**, **append-only** (WORM-compliant) audit log. This ensures logs cannot be overwritten or deleted except through defined rotation processes.
*   Supports **integrity verification** with checksums to detect tampering. This allows verification of individual logs or the entire log set.
*   Provides **secure key management** for encryption, recommending storage in a secure vault and adherence to compliance policies for key rotation.
*   Audit logging is integrated into the platform's **event-driven architecture**, capturing events as they occur.
*   The system includes dedicated components and comprehensive testing for audit logging functionality.

**Features for Working with Logs:**
NexusMCP provides extensive features for accessing, analyzing, and managing audit logs:
*   **Filtering** logs by various criteria such as user, action, resource, status, event type, channel, and date range.
*   **Viewing** logs through a user-friendly interface in the Admin Console UI.
*   **Exporting** logs in various formats including CSV, JSON, PDF, and Excel.
*   **Real-time security event forwarding to SIEM systems** (Security Information and Event Management). Integration with popular SIEM systems is supported.
*   **Real-time Alerting** based on audit events, including detection of suspicious activities and security events. Threshold-based and immediate alerts are supported, with integration capabilities for external alerting systems.
*   Configurable **log retention policies**, allowing logs to be retained for the period required by specific compliance regimes (e.g., 1â€“7 years).
*   Supports **Log Rotation and Archival**.
*   Includes **backup mechanisms** for critical events. Automated Backup & Disaster Recovery features also apply to audit logs.
*   Offers **Log Visualization** through charts and graphs, a Compliance Dashboard, and an Analytics Dashboard.
*   Access to log endpoints and the audit log viewer is protected by **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, requiring appropriate roles like admin or notification:manage.
*   APIs are provided for audit log search, export, and maintenance, including specific endpoints like `/api/audit` and `/api/notifications/logs`.

**Compliance Standards Supported:**
NexusMCP's audit logging system is built to align with various industry standards and regulations:
*   Compliance with **ISO** (ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018, 27701), **OWASP** (Top 10, Application Security Verification Standard), and **NIST** (Cybersecurity Framework, SP 800-53, SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture) standards.
*   Supports specific regulations like **GDPR** and **CCPA** through data privacy features including PII masking.
*   Supports **SOC 2 Type II compliance**.
*   Compliance reporting supports various standards, explicitly mentioning **GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and PCI-DSS**.
*   Automated audit evidence and compliance reports are part of the compliance automation features.
*   All features, including audit logging, are designed for **ISO/enterprise standards**.
