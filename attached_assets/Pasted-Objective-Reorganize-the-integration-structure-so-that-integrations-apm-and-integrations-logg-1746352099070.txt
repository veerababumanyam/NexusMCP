Objective:
Reorganize the integration structure so that `/integrations/apm` and `/integrations/logging` are merged as tabs within a single comprehensive page: `/integrations/monitoring`.

Design & Implementation Guidelines:

1. **New Unified Page:** `/integrations/monitoring`
   - Title: "Monitoring, Logging & Observability"
   - Purpose: Provide complete visibility into application health, performance, and usage aligned with enterprise-grade observability standards.

2. **Tabs Structure on `/integrations/monitoring`:**
   - Tab 1: **Application Monitoring (APM & Infrastructure)**
     - Supported Tools: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Grafana, Prometheus
     - Integration Methods: 
       - Expose KPIs via Prometheus format or compatible endpoints
       - Implement `/health` APIs for uptime checks
   - Tab 2: **Log Aggregation**
     - Supported Systems: Splunk, ELK Stack, Graylog, Datadog Logs, Azure Monitor Logs, GCP Logging
     - Integration Methods:
       - Forward logs in formats like JSON, Syslog, CEF, LEEF
       - Connect to centralized log aggregators

3. **Implementation Requirements:**
   - Update **sidebar navigation**: “Monitoring” linking to `/integrations/monitoring`
   - Modify **routing config** to support the new unified route `/integrations/monitoring` with tab-based rendering
   - Backend:
     - Consolidate APM and Logging configuration endpoints under a common controller/module
     - Maintain existing functionality but group under unified service architecture
	 = integrate with local databse for local copy
   - Frontend:
     - Design a tabbed interface with clear titles and descriptions
     - Ensure each tab loads content asynchronously for performance
   - Middleware:
     - Ensure middleware and auth layers apply correctly to the unified route
     - Logging and monitoring setup should be configurable per tenant/workspace if multi-tenant
   - Entry Point:
     - Update `App.tsx` or relevant root config to import the new monitoring page correctly with lazy-loading enabled
	 
4. **Compliance & Production-Readiness:**
   - Ensure solution supports enterprise scalability, fault-tolerance, and seamless app integration
   - Include dark/light mode UI support
   - Ensure observability components follow standard security best practices

Output:
A fully functional, enterprise-ready Monitoring Integration UI and backend service that covers APM and Logging in a single, intuitive interface.
