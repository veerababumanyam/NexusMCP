Universal Agent Support: A fundamental feature is the platform's ability to provide universal support for AI agents.

Agent Registration: NexusMCP supports the registration of any AI agent compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is designed for AI Developers integrating various AI tools and frameworks. The platform architecture includes specific flows for agent registration.
Agent Authentication: Supports the authentication of registered MCP-compatible agents, integrating with the platform's enterprise-grade authentication system.
Secure Communication: Enables secure communication for any registered MCP-compatible agent, including agent-to-agent communication.
Agent Configuration: The platform includes features for managing agent configuration, with specific configuration flows implemented within the architecture.

Agent Lifecycle Management: NexusMCP supports the full lifecycle management of agents, including implemented lifecycle management flows.

Multi-Agent Workflows & Orchestration: This feature set builds on agent registration to enable complex interactions.

Enables Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication. This communication facilitates interaction between agents and is managed via the platform's GUI and APIs. It includes support for A2A routing, authentication, and logging within multi-agent workflows. A2A is described as Google's open protocol for communication between independent AI agents.
Supports multi-agent orchestration to build complex workflows. This orchestration is also managed via the GUI and APIs by the platform's workflow engine. The management of agents is supported through these interfaces as part of the orchestration capabilities.
Agent Extensibility: The platform is designed to be extensible to accommodate new agent types.

Provides APIs and SDKs (specifically Python and TypeScript are mentioned) for integrating new agent types and frameworks. This aligns with the platform's broader ecosystem development features like the plugin system and connector marketplace.
All actions related to agent integration using these APIs and SDKs are subject to the platform's comprehensive security features, including logging, auditing, and policy enforcement.
Agent Marketplace & Discovery: NexusMCP includes an Agent Marketplace & Discovery UI. This functions as a central hub for finding and potentially installing available agent integrations.

Agent Template System & Simulation Framework: These are listed as key features that provide additional support for working with agents.

Supported Agent Types: The architecture for Universal Agent Support is explicitly designed to support any MCP-compatible AI agent. This is intended to cover a wide range of agent types, including LLMs, RAG agents, workflow bots, custom agent frameworks, and future agent types, not being limited to specific kits like Google's ADK.

Security and Compliance Integration: Agent-related features, including registration, communication, and management, are tightly integrated with the platform's overall security and compliance framework. This includes enforcement of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), comprehensive Audit Logging, and centralized Policy Enforcement. The platform operates under a strict Zero Trust security model, which applies to all agent interactions.
